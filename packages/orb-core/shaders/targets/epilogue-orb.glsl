// Orbic epilogue — orb shape, GLSL ES 3.00.
//
// Maps the fragment coordinate into aspect-preserving world space at orb
// scale (p spans roughly a unit disc — see docs/shader-abi.md) and calls
// the compositor. `u_time` is assumed already wrapped (at 3600 s) by the
// caller before being written to this uniform; the epilogue does no
// per-pixel wrapping of its own.
//
// `edge` and `backlight` are orb-specific — NOT part of the frozen
// four-channel ABI, which field()/composite() alone see. They are the Orb
// component's public props, and they live here rather than in the compositor
// because composite()'s signature is frozen: no per-instance value can reach
// it. What an epilogue CAN do is post-process what the compositor returned,
// and it has `p`, so it can work in the same geometry the compositor did.
//
// `edge` narrows the silhouette feather. It works in the FEATHER COORDINATE
// rather than on alpha, and that distinction is load-bearing: with a
// transparent core the interior sits around alpha 0.42 while the feather
// sweeps 0.6 down to 0, so the two ranges OVERLAP and no alpha-space remap
// can tell them apart. An earlier version tried, and raising `edge` hollowed
// out the middle of the orb instead of tightening its edge. Because this
// epilogue shares the compositor's constants and formula, it can divide the
// compositor's own feather back out and substitute a narrower one, leaving
// interior density untouched.
//
// `backlight` is a light BEHIND the sphere: it brightens the limb from behind
// and spills a little past the silhouette, which is how a translucent object
// reads as lit. Deliberately not the additive white rim an earlier compositor
// drew and which was removed for looking like a hard outline stamped on the
// background — this glow is tinted by the field's own colour and carries its
// own alpha, so it reads as light AROUND the object rather than a ring
// painted on it. The halo has only ORB_RADIUS..0.5 of world space before the
// square viewport clips it, so it is deliberately tight; widening it means
// shrinking ORB_RADIUS, which shrinks the orb inside its box.
//
// Both read ORB_RADIUS and ORB_LIMB_FEATHER straight from the compositor: the
// build concatenates preamble + field + compositor + epilogue into a single
// translation unit, so its program-scope constants are in scope here.
