#version 300 es
// Orbic shader preamble — GLSL ES 3.00 (WebGL2).
//
// Declares the frozen four-channel uniform ABI as globals (GLSL reads
// uniforms as globals) and the portable-subset shims. A field or compositor
// body never declares a `uniform` itself — see docs/shader-abi.md.
//
// `#version` is the literal first line, with no leading comment or
// whitespace before it — some real ES-profile front-ends (observed: the
// glslang WASM build used to validate this file) reject a shader where the
// version directive isn't the first thing in the source, even though a
// leading comment is legal per some readings of the GLSL spec. Not worth
// the risk on the one directive every target requires.

// Real surface compositor (task 6.4): a full-bleed, always-static
// background that must recede behind body text rather than draw attention
// to itself (see docs/shader-abi.md and design.md's "two visual jobs at
// once" framing). Two mechanisms, each doing one job:
//
//   1. A small multi-tap spatial average of `field()` — NOT a second
//      render pass (there is still exactly one fragment shader invocation
//      per pixel; this just calls the same portable `field()` a few more
//      times at nearby world-space offsets and averages the results), so
//      it doesn't fork the shader core the way a real bloom/blur pass
//      would (see design.md decision #10 on why multi-pass is rejected).
//      This is the *only* way this file can achieve "octave/detail
//      reduction" at all: composite() has no access to field()'s internal
//      noise octaves, so the only lever available from this side of the
//      contract is spatial averaging, which low-pass-filters whatever
//      detail field() produced. The same averaging also attenuates
//      per-pixel hash grain, since nearby grain samples are decorrelated
//      and their average trends toward the grain's mean — one mechanism
//      serving both the "octave/detail reduction" and "grain attenuation"
//      requirements in specs/surface-component/spec.md.
//   2. Contrast damping — the blurred colour is pulled toward a fixed dark
//      anchor tone, compressing the field's dynamic range.
//
// A Surface is static (rendered once, never re-evaluated per frame — see
// design.md decision #9), so the extra `field()` evaluations here are a
// one-time cost, not a per-frame one; this trade would not be acceptable
// in the animated orb compositor and is not made there.
//
// Returns PREMULTIPLIED colour and alpha (`vec4(rgb * a, a)`), per the
// two-function contract in docs/shader-abi.md. Alpha is always 1.0 here —
// a Surface is a full-bleed background, not a masked shape — but it is
// still returned premultiplied so both compositors obey one convention.
//
// --- Luminance band (tuned against real renders — see handback) ---------
// specs/surface-component/spec.md requires TWO things about brightness,
// not one, and they bound this from opposite sides:
//   - a CEILING: WCAG AA 4.5:1 between this compositor's *brightest*
//     rendered luminance and the body-text colour, checked against the max
//     rather than the mean, so one hotspot can't pass on a good average.
//   - a FLOOR ("the field must remain perceptible"): rendered luminance
//     range must span at least a defined minimum, because a contrast
//     floor alone is satisfied vacuously by a near-black surface — that
//     passes legibility while destroying the entire premise that a
//     Surface is the Orb's material seen from further away.
//
// A single LINEAR mix toward a fixed anchor tone (an earlier version of
// this file used `mix(base, blurred, contrast)`) cannot satisfy both at
// once, because the shipped fields' own post-blur brightest points are far
// apart: measured directly (bypassing this file's damping), Veils peaks
// around 0.18-0.28, while Chladni and Silk's brightest presets reach
// 0.82-0.92 -- almost the full [0,1] range field() is allowed to use. Any
// single linear (base, contrast) pair that lifts Veils to something
// visible pushes Chladni/Silk's already-bright peaks straight past the
// WCAG ceiling (measured: contrast 0.62 lifted Veils to a visible ~13:1,
// but put Chladni's brightest preset at 3.09:1, failing the 4.5:1 floor
// outright). And a pair chosen to keep Chladni safe leaves Veils at
// visually-black RGB(30,31,35) -- the over-damping this section originally
// shipped with.
//
// So this compresses instead of linearly mixing: a Reinhard-style knee,
// `gained / (1 + gained * SURFACE_KNEE)`, which behaves close to linear
// for small inputs (so dim background areas between veils/folds keep their
// own relative detail — the "range" the perceptibility floor cares about)
// but compresses hard as input grows, pulling bright fields' peaks down
// disproportionately more than dim fields' peaks. `SURFACE_GAIN` and
// `SURFACE_KNEE` were solved from two real measured points -- Veils'
// dimmest realistic peak (~0.20) and Chladni/Silk's brightest (~0.90) --
// so that both land inside a visible-but-safe band (~0.22 and ~0.35 in
// output-channel terms respectively, roughly 7-12:1 against white body
// text) rather than one of them sitting at either extreme. See
// tools/render-check/contrast-check.mjs's `checkPerceptibility` for the
// floor, `checkContrast` for the ceiling, and its printed table for the
// current measured range of every field x preset combination.

//
// u_scale is surface-specific — not part of the frozen four-channel ABI
// (energy/coherence/warmth/pulse), which field()/composite() alone see.
// It's plumbing local to this epilogue, the same way any other uniform is
// per design.md decision #2, exposed as the Surface component's public
// `scale` prop (surface-component spec). The renderer defaults it to 3.0,
// matching this file's previous hardcoded SURFACE_SCALE, so omitting the
// prop is behaviourally identical to before this uniform existed.
